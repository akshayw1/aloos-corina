# Atlan Cloud Cost Management 

## Problem Statement


Atlan is facing three interconnected challenges with cloud costs:

1. **Delayed Detection**: Currently, there's a significant lag between when cost increases occur and when the team becomes aware of them. By the time cost issues are identified, substantial unnecessary spending has already occurred. 

2. **Source Identification**: When cost increases are eventually detected, the team struggles to identify the exact sources. This creates a "guessing game" situation where engineers must manually investigate various services, projects, and resources to determine what's driving the cost increase

3. **Optimization Pathways**: Even after identifying cost sources, there's no clear methodology for determining which optimizations would yield the highest savings with the least effort. This makes cost optimization more of an ad-hoc process than a systematic approach.

## Proposed Solution Overview

### High-Level Architecture

        A1[AWS CloudWatch] 
        A2[Azure Monitor]
        A3[GCP Monitoring]

    end
    
    subgraph "Processing Layer"
        B1[Cost Anomaly Detection]
        B2[Cost Attribution Engine]
        B3[Optimization Recommender]
    end
    
    subgraph "Visualization Layer"

    subgraph "Action Layer"
        D1[Alert System]
        D2[Auto-Scaling Rules]
        D3[Resource Scheduler]
        D4[Budget Controls]
    end
    
    A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 --> B1 & B2 & B3
    B1 & B2 & B3 --> C1 & C2
    C1 & C2 --> D1 & D2 & D3 & D4
```

The proposed architecture consists of four distinct layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - **AWS CloudWatch**: Captures detailed AWS resource metrics and usage data
   - **Azure Monitor**: Collects Azure resource performance and cost data
   - **GCP Monitoring**: Gathers Google Cloud resource metrics and billing information
   - **Resource Tagging**: Implements a consistent tagging strategy across all cloud resources

2. **Processing Layer**:
   - **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Analyzes cost patterns to identify unusual spikes or trends
   - **Cost Attribution Engine**: Maps costs to specific teams, projects, and applications
   - **Optimization Recommender**: Suggests cost-saving measures based on usage patterns

3. **Visualization Layer**:
   - **Real-time Dashboard**: Provides up-to-date cost visibility across all cloud platforms
   - **Trend Analysis & Forecasting**: Predicts future costs and highlights concerning trends

4. **Action Layer**:
   - **Alert System**: Notifies relevant stakeholders of cost anomalies
   - **Auto-Scaling Rules**: Automatically adjusts resources based on demand
   - **Resource Scheduler**: Manages non-production resources during off-hours
   - **Budget Controls**: Enforces spending limits and approval workflows

### Process Flow

```mermaid

    [*] --> Collect_Data: Daily Cloud Cost Data
    
    Collect_Data --> Process_Analyze: Raw Cost Data
    Process_Analyze --> Anomaly_Check: Cost Metrics
    
    Anomaly_Check --> Normal_Flow: No Anomaly
    Anomaly_Check --> Alert_Flow: Anomaly Detected
    
    Normal_Flow --> Update_Dashboard: Regular Update
    Update_Dashboard --> Collect_Data: Continuous Monitoring
    
    Alert_Flow --> Send_Alert: Notify Team
    Send_Alert --> Identify_Source: Investigate
    Identify_Source --> Implement_Action: Optimization Action
    Implement_Action --> Collect_Data: Resume Monitoring
    
    state Normal_Flow {
        [*] --> Trend_Analysis
        Trend_Analysis --> Cost_Forecasting
        Cost_Forecasting --> Optimization_Suggestions
        Optimization_Suggestions --> [*]
    }
    
    state Alert_Flow {
        [*] --> Priority_Assessment
        Priority_Assessment --> Resource_Analysis
        Resource_Analysis --> Action_Recommendation
        Action_Recommendation --> [*]
    }
```

The process flow has two main paths:

**Normal Flow**:
1. Cost data is collected daily from all cloud providers
2. Data is processed and analyzed for patterns
3. If no anomalies are detected, dashboards are updated with current trends
4. The system performs trend analysis and forecasting
5. Optimization suggestions are generated based on normal usage patterns
6. The cycle continues with ongoing monitoring

**Alert Flow**:
1. When cost anomalies are detected, alerts are triggered
2. The team is notified through configured channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
3. The priority of the anomaly is assessed based on size and impact
4. A detailed resource analysis is performed to identify the cost source
5. Specific action recommendations are generated
6. The team implements optimization actions
7. The cycle returns to monitoring
